abstract = {Abstract Stone's method for assessing disease risk around a point source through isotonic regression is routinely used in spatial epidemiology. It is useful in situations where the relationship of risk with exposure (distance being commonly used as a surrogate variable) is assumed monotonic but otherwise of unknown form. This paper extends this method to non-spatial epidemiology, where typically two or more risk factors are present. The methodology described is based on the additive isotonic model approach of Bacchetti; versions appropriate to count (Poisson) data and case-control (binomial) data are described. In both cases, adjustment for covariates is incorporated, and a Monte Carlo method of hypothesis testing and interval estimation is presented. The methodology is illustrated through a case-control example concerning the analysis of the possible effect of preconceptional external ionizing radiation doses on the sex ratio at birth among children of fathers working at the Sellafield nuclear installation, Cumbria, U.K. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {A method is developed for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of points on a surface of unspecified algebraic form when ordinates of the points are required to satisfy a set of linear inequalities. A production function with one variable input is considered in some detail. In this case the restrictions follow from the assumption of non-increasing returns. An illustrative computation is worked out using a procedure based on equivalence between the estimation problem and a certain saddle point problem. Alternative procedures for production functions with two variable inputs are sketched.},

 abstract = {This article shows how Bayesian inference for switching regression models and their generalizations can be achieved by the specification of loss functions which overcome the label switching problem common to all mixture models. We also derive an extension to models where the number of components in the mixture is unknown, based on the birth-and-death technique developed in recent literature. The methods are illustrated on various real datasets.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Kernel smoothing is studied in partial linear models, i.e. semiparametric models of the form , where the ξi are fixed known p vectors, β is an unknown vector parameter and f is a smooth but unknown function. Two methods of estimating β and f are considered, one related to partial smoothing splines and the other motivated by partial residual analysis. Under suitable assumptions, the asymptotic bias and variance are obtained for both methods, and it is shown that estimating β by partial residuals results in improved bias with no asymptotic loss in variance. Application to analysis of covariance is made, and several examples are presented.},

abstract="Finite mixture models have now been used for more than hundred years (Newcomb (1886), Pearson (1894)). They are a very popular statistical modeling technique given that they constitute a flexible and-easily extensible model class for (1) approximating general distribution functions in a semi-parametric way and (2) accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. The number of applications has tremendously increased in the last decades as model estimation in a frequentist as well as a Bayesian framework has become feasible with the nowadays easily available computing power.",
